# Python Keylogger

This Python script implements a basic keylogger that records and logs keystrokes to a file (`keylog.txt`).

## Disclaimer

**Note: Keyloggers can be considered intrusive and raise ethical concerns. Ensure that you have explicit permission from system owners before using or deploying this software.**

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-keylogger.git
   cd python-keylogger
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**

   Install the `pynput` package using pip if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

3. **Run the Keylogger**

   Execute the `keylogger.py` script to start the keylogger:

   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

4. **View the Keylog**

   As you type, the keystrokes will be logged to the `keylog.txt` file in the same directory.

## Notes

- The keylogger logs all keystrokes except for special keys like Shift, Ctrl, Alt, etc.
- The logged keystrokes are saved in plain text format in the `keylog.txt` file.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Use this tool responsibly and only for lawful and ethical purposes. Always obtain proper authorization before deploying this software on any system.
